            <section> 
                <p>Today, we’d like to highlight and celebrate Jereme Brisco’s 5-year anniversary as the founding member of Genesis Wealth Management. At Genesis Wealth Management, we pride ourselves on having a team that is experienced, dedicated, and the best of the best. And, as part of our work-family culture, we support each other and celebrate each other’s success.</p>
                <h4>Meet Jereme Brisco</h4>
                <p>When it came time for Jereme to choose a career path, he knew it had to line up with two things—his values and his interests. For Jereme, that meant using his natural problem-solving abilities and love of numbers to add value to others’ lives. He found the perfect fit for his skills and passions in financial planning.</p>
                
                <h4>His Journey</h4>
                <p>Throughout his 20 years in the financial industry, Jereme has prioritized building strong, long-lasting relationships with his clients so he can help them pursue their life goals, both personally and financially. After a successful 12-year career at USAA, he founded Genesis Wealth Management in 2016. At Genesis Wealth, Jereme works hard to provide high-touch, customized financial solutions for every aspect of his clients’ lives.</p>
                <p>Today, as a Wealth Manager and CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™, Jereme uses his experience and industry knowledge to empower a select group of clients to make confident decisions and pursue their dreams.</p>
                
                <h4>The Best Part</h4>
                <p>Jereme genuinely loves what he does. He loves seeing the relief on his clients’ faces when they see their strategies laid out in front of them and realize they aren’t in this alone. Seeing his clients experience success is why he enjoys his job so much.</p>
                <p>Jereme doesn’t just go above and beyond for his clients; he also gives his all to his family and his community. Jereme and his wife spend their free time serving at their church and are involved in their children’s various activities. As a family, the Briscos enjoy attending sporting events and eating at their favorite local restaurants in San Antonio.</p>
                <p>Jereme’s son, Bryce, is a senior at San Antonio Christian School, where he plays multiple instruments in the band. He will attend Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, in fall 2021, and will be studying music business. Jereme’s daughter, Liliana, is a freshman at Clark High School. She plays club volleyball and is also on the high school volleyball team.</p>
                <p>Jereme’s wife, Rachel, is a beloved kindergarten teacher, and she recently completed her master’s degree in administration at Trinity University. Jereme is looking forward to cheering her on as she receives her degree in December.</p>

                <h4>An Invaluable Leader</h4>
                <p>Without Jereme’s personal courage to leave a long, secure career with his previous employer and founding Genesis Wealth Management, we wouldn’t be here today. The foundation he laid, along with his confidence, calming spirit, drew many of his former colleagues and friends to join him and Genesis Wealth, creating an unparalleled culture and client experience.</p>
                <p>Jereme is a servant leader who puts others first—something his teammates and clients can easily attest to. He encourages positive change and ensures every decision we make as an organization can be traced back to our overarching determination to do what benefits our clients.</p>
                <h4>Want to Know More?</h4>
                <p>Every member of the Genesis Wealth Management team makes it his or her mission to help you use your wealth to live the life you want, both today and in the future.
